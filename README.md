# Identify Metadata

This project is an evolution of the [Identify Tool](https://webmap.ornl.gov/qaqc/identify) that was developed to allow ORNL DAAC staff doing quality assurance work on datasets in the publication process to quickly get information about a particular coordinate (lat/lon) as a means to check information in the dataset.

The tool is being expanded to support other projects, including the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative](https://microbiomedata.org) (NMDC).  For NMDC, there's a particular use case of wanting to annotate the metadata for a sample collected at a particular time and place.  Those annotations can include elevation above sea level, land cover classification, soil classificaiton, and climatology.
